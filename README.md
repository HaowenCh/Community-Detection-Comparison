# Take-home Assignment for Studies in Community Detection, Modularity and Markov Stability

The project contains a Jupyter notebook and benchmark graphs generated by varies methods to evaluate partitions created by different Community Detection algorithms.

## Jupyter Notebook

The notebook contains comparisons on 8 different Community Detection algorithms, utilizing 500 ABCD graphs and python packages like **PyGenStability, CDlib, networkX, graph-tool, bayanpy** with AMI measurement function provided in **Scipy** package.
<br>
<br>
The estimated runtime of the Jupyter notebook is around 500 min per 100 graphs. To avoid long runtime caused by algorithms ```MR```, ```MV```, and ```Bayan```, when execute the python code block, comment out following code in the last code section to control algorithms running for each ABCD graph.

```
results['MV'].append(MV_Run(G))
results['MR'].append(MR_Run(G))
results['Bayan'].append(Bayan_Run(G))
...
results['Infomap'].append(Infomap_Run(G))
```

- **PyGenStability** (v0.2.2)

- **CDlib** (v0.2.6) 

- **NetworkX** (v2.8.8)
